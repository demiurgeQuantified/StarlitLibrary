Starlit Library is a general usage library for Project Zomboid mods. Due to the complications involved in using dependencies in Project Zomboid, everything of use that I write will be collected here: it does not have one specific scope or purpose.

## Documentation
See the [docs](https://demiurgequantified.github.io/StarlitLibrary/) for documentation.

## Usage
Anyone can use Starlit Library as a dependency, but **do not copy its files into your mod**. You cannot redistribute any part of the library without express permission.
